# Kudocs Tech Exercise

## Exercise Intro

In this exercise, you'll see that there's a method in the `PhonePlan` class that calculates the cost of a plan differently depending on its type. However, the class should only know how to retrieve the cost, not the details of how to calculate it.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to clone and run the setup script for the repo

    git clone git@github.com:kudocs/tech-exercise.git
    cd tech-exercise
    bin/setup

Open up `lib/phone_plan.rb`. There you will see a single method named `cost`. Its corresponding tests are in `spec/lib/phone_plan_spec.rb`.

Make sure all the tests are passing by running:

    bundle exec rspec
		
Create a branch that includes your name
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-name-goes-here main
	 ```

Once done make sure all the specs are passing and push any changes made to your feature branch.
Inside the PR you have the opportunity to eloborate on any of the following if you feel neccessary:
 
 * Any assumptions you made.
 * What potential problems can you identify with the existing code?
 * What approaches did you consider?
 * How does your changes improve this code?
 * Anything else you feel relevant?

The above will form the basis of a more technical discussion.
