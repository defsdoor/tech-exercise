# Kudocs Tech Exercise

## Exercise Intro

In this exercise, you'll see that there's a method in the `PhonePlan` class that calculates the cost of a plan differently depending on its type. However, the class should only know how to retrieve the cost, not the details of how to calculate it.

## Instructions

To start, you'll want to fork this repo and run the setup script

    cd tech-exercise
    bin/setup

Open up `lib/phone_plan.rb`. There you will see a single method named `cost`. Its corresponding tests are in `spec/lib/phone_plan_spec.rb`.

Make sure all the tests are passing by running:

    bundle exec rspec

Create a PR and within the PR description you have the opportunity to eloborate on any of the following if you feel neccessary:
 
 * Any assumptions you made.
 * What potential problems can you identify with the existing code?
 * What approaches did you consider?
 * How does your changes improve this code?
 * Anything else you feel relevant?

The above will form the basis of a more technical discussion.
